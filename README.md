## About AuthRail

AuthRail is a deterministic, framework-agnostic policy engine designed for modern web applications. It provides a type-safe way to define and execute authorization logic by treating authorization as a pure function.

Instead of coupling authorization rules to your database schema or a specific framework, AuthRail allows you to define evaluation "Rails" that process a given context (such as user details and resource metadata) to return a clear decision: allow, deny, or redirect.
