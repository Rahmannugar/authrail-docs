import { CodeBlock } from "fumadocs-ui/components/codeblock";

This page documents explicit constraints of the system.

---

## Not an Authentication System

AuthRail does not:

- Authenticate users
- Manage sessions
- Issue tokens
- Store credentials

It assumes authentication has already occurred.

---

## Not a Router

AuthRail does not:

- Navigate automatically
- Modify history state
- Integrate with any routing library

It emits redirect intent.
Your application performs navigation.

---

## No Global State

Each `evaluate()` call is independent.

There is:

- No shared state
- No caching
- No cross-request memory

---

## No Implicit Parallelism

Middleware runs sequentially.

There is no:

- Parallel execution
- Reordering
- Lazy evaluation

---

## Context Is Immutable

Middleware receives:

```ts
Readonly<Ctx>;
```

Direct mutation is discouraged.

If enrichment is needed:

<CodeBlock>
```ts
return { context: { ... } };
```
</CodeBlock>

Context merging is shallow.
