AuthRail can emit evaluation logs when debug mode is enabled.

---

## Enabling Debug Mode

<CodeBlock>
```ts
createRail("admin", middleware, { debug: true });
```
</CodeBlock>

When enabled, each middleware execution is logged.

Example output:

<CodeBlock>
```text
[AuthRail:admin] → requireAuthMiddleware
[AuthRail:admin] → requireRoleMiddleware
[AuthRail:admin] decision → allow
```
</CodeBlock>

---

## What Gets Logged

When `debug` is enabled:

- Each middleware invocation
- Context enrichment events
- Final decision

Logging is performed using `console.log`.

AuthRail does not bundle a logging library.
