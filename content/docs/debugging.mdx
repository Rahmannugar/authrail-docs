# Debugging

AuthRail can emit evaluation logs when debug mode is enabled.

---

## Enabling Debug Mode

```ts
createRail("admin", middleware, { debug: true });
```

When enabled, each middleware execution is logged.

Example output:

```text
[AuthRail:admin] → requireAuthMiddleware
[AuthRail:admin] → requireRoleMiddleware
[AuthRail:admin] decision → allow
```

---

## What Gets Logged

When `debug` is enabled:

- Each middleware invocation
- Context enrichment events
- Final decision

Logging is performed using `console.log`.

AuthRail does not bundle a logging library.
