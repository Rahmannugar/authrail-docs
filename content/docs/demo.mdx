title: Demo & Live Testing
description: Experience AuthRail in action with our interactive demo applications.
---

The best way to understand **AuthRail** is to see it in action. We've provided a comprehensive demo application and a playground to help you explore its capabilities.

## Interactive Demo

Our official demo showcases AuthRail integrated into a real-world React application using Vite and React Router.

### What's Inside?

- **Route Protection**: Automated redirects for unauthorized users. Experience how AuthRail intercepts unauthorized navigation attempts before they reach your components, ensuring a secure and seamless flow.
- **Granular Permissions**: UI elements that appear or disappear based on user roles. See how easy it is to conditionally render components or disable actions using the `protect()` HOC or `RailBoundary`.
- **Dynamic Policy Toggling**: A control panel to modify permissions in real-time. This highlights AuthRail's reactivity—watch the UI instantly adapt as you toggle policies without a page reload.
- **Detailed Debugging**: Real-time logs showing why a policy was allowed or denied. AuthRail provides a transparent look into the decision-making process, making it incredibly easy to debug complex permission logic.

### Why use the demo?

The demo serves as a living blueprint. Instead of just reading about middleware and rails, you can interact with them. It demonstrates best practices for:

- Managing authentication state in a React app.
- Structuring complex permission rules into maintainable rails.
- Handling redirects and "Access Denied" states gracefully.
- Integrating AuthRail with popular routing libraries like React Router.

### Try it Locally

You can run the demo on your own machine to experiment with the code:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahmannugar/authrail-demo
   cd authrail-demo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to start testing.

## Testing Scenarios

When running the demo, try the following scenarios to see how AuthRail handles them:

### 1. Unauthenticated Access

Try navigating to `/dashboard` or `/admin` without logging in. AuthRail will detect the lack of authentication and redirect you to the `/login` page.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Log in with the demo credentials:

- **Email**: `user@demo.com`
- **Password**: `password`

Attempt to access the **Admin Portal**. You'll notice that while you can access the dashboard, the Admin area is restricted because your role is `user`, not `admin`.

### 3. Dynamic Policy Toggling

Use the **Policy Control Panel** in the demo to toggle "Block Dashboard" or "Grant Admin Clearance". This demonstrates how AuthRail evaluates policies dynamically based on the current context.

### 4. Deterministic Debugging

Open the browser console. AuthRail logs the evaluation process, providing transparency into which middleware allowed or denied access and why.
