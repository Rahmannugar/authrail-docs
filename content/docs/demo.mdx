description: Experience AuthRail in action with our interactive demo application.

The best way to understand **AuthRail** is to see it in action. We've provided a comprehensive demo application and a playground to help you explore its capabilities.

## Interactive Demo

Our official demo showcases AuthRail integrated into a real-world React application using Vite and React Router. It demonstrates how to handle authentication state, multi-step policies, and real-time UI updates.

### What's Inside?

- **Route Protection**: Automated redirects for unauthorized users. Experience how AuthRail intercepts unauthorized navigation attempts before they reach your components, ensuring a secure and seamless flow.
- **Granular Permissions**: UI elements that appear or disappear based on user roles. See how easy it is to conditionally render components or disable actions using the `protect()` HOC or `RailBoundary`.
- **Dynamic Policy Toggling**: A control panel to modify permissions in real-time. This highlights AuthRail's reactivity—watch the UI instantly adapt as you toggle policies without a page reload.
- **Detailed Debugging**: Real-time logs showing why a policy was allowed or denied. AuthRail provides a transparent look into the decision-making process, making it incredibly easy to debug complex permission logic.

### Why use the demo?

The demo serves as a living blueprint. Instead of just reading about middleware and rails, you can interact with them. It demonstrates best practices for:

- Managing authentication state in a React app.
- Structuring complex permission rules into maintainable rails.
- Handling redirects and "Access Denied" states gracefully.
- Integrating AuthRail with popular routing libraries like React Router.

### Try it Locally

You can run the demo on your own machine to experiment with the code:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahmannugar/authrail-demo
   cd authrail-demo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to start testing.

## Testing Scenarios

When running the demo, try the following scenarios to see how AuthRail handle edge cases:

### 1. Unauthenticated Access

**Action**: Log out and try to navigate directly to `/dashboard`.

**Observation**: AuthRail's `requireAuth` middleware detects the null user and emits a `redirect` decision. The application intercepts this and sends you to `/login`.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Action**: Log in as a standard user and try to click the "Admin Settings" link.

**Observation**: The link might be hidden (using `RailBoundary`), but if you navigate directly to `/admin`, the `requireRole('admin')` middleware returns a `deny` decision, rendering the "Access Restricted" fallback.

### 3. Real-time Policy Updates

**Action**: In the Dashboard, toggle the "Emergency Lockdown" button.

**Observation**: Watch how the protected content instantly disappears and is replaced by the lockdown fallback. This demonstrates AuthRail's reactivity—by updating the evaluation context, your `RailBoundary` or `protect()` HOC responds immediately without a page reload.

### 4. Deterministic Debugging

**Action**: Open your browser's Developer Tools (Console tab).

**Observation**: With `debug: true` enabled in the rail configuration, you can see every step of the evaluation. It will show exactly which check failed and what data was in the context at that moment.
